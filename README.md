# Baleen

Baleen is an extensible text processing capability that allows entity-related information to be extracted from unstructured and semi-structured data sources. It makes available in a structured format things of interest otherwise stored in formats such as text documents - references to people, organisations, unique identifiers, location information.

Baleen is written in [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) using the software project management tool [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org) and draws heavily on the [Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)](http://uima.apache.org) which provides a framework, components and infrastructure to handle unstructured information management.    

Baleen was written by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) in support of UK Defence users looking to extract entities and search unstructured text documents. License information can be found in the accompanying `LICENSE.txt` file in this repository and the licenses of libraries on which Baleen is dependent are listed in the file `THIRD-PARTY.txt`.

Baleen is still under active development, and is released here not as a final product but as a work in progress. As such, there may be bugs, issues, typos, mistakes in the documentation, and more. We hope that contributions from other users will improve Baleen and result in a better framework for others to use.

# Upgrading to 2.4

Baleen 2.4 contains a number of changes that may make it incompatible with older pipelines - for upgrade guidance see the [Upgrading Between Versions](https://github.com/dstl/baleen/wiki/Upgrading-Between-Versions#upgrading-230-to-240) wiki page.

# Getting Started

Baleen includes an in-built server, which hosts full documentation and guides on how to use Baleen.
To get started, you will need to launch this server and read this documentation.
To launch the server, run one of the following commands.

> `java -jar baleen-2.4.0.jar`

> `docker-compose -f example/docker-compose.yml up`

Once running, the server can be accessed at [http://localhost:6413](http://localhost:6413).

If you require the Javadoc to be available through the in-built server, then you should place the Baleen Javadoc JAR in the same directory as the Baleen JAR.
